## Live City Search

Original version of a JavaScript live search application created during my JavaScript module.

**Module:** JavaScript  
**Goal:** API Handling and Live Search Function  
**Status:** ✅ Done  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Technologies:** JavaScript, Bulma  

## Description
In this exercise, we had to build a small web application with four input fields:
- City  
- ZIP Code (readonly)  
- Longitude (readonly)  
- Latitude (readonly)  

A live search function was implemented to display city suggestions in a dropdown list as the user types.  
Once a city is selected, the ZIP code is filled in automatically.  
Using the ZIP code, the app retrieves longitude and latitude values via an external Web API and displays them in the form.

## Features
- Live search suggestions
- Auto-fill ZIP code
- Fetching coordinates via Web API
- Real-time UI updates

## Main Goal
Implementing and handling APIs in JavaScript, creating a dynamic live search with real-time data.
